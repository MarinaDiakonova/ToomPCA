# ToomPCA

PCA with cells whose colours change depending on the average of some neighbourhood, with error as a parameter.

These can be used to see non-uniqueness of the future. Particularly for the two-state system, low error rate leads to all the square becoming either one or the other colour. For a very high error rate, the colours will alternate, but after any long time T either colour can be dominating.

This repository contains folders for the 2-state PCA ('Non_symmetric_PCA'), and a 3-state PCA ('PCA_Three_v3'). I suspect the reason the latter is v3 is that there were more ways to construct a 3-state version, and this is only one of them.

The particulars of parameters can be found within each folder, as well as in the 'About' screen within the app itself.
