PCA with cells whose colours change depending on the average of some neighbourhood, with error as a parameter.

These can be used to see non-uniqueness of the future. Particularly for the two-state system, low error rate leads to all the square becoming either one or the other colour. For a very high error rate, the colours will alternate, but after any long time T either colour can be dominating.

The particulars of parameters can be found within each folder, as well as in the 'About' screen within the app itself.

This was written in v2 and modified for v3.
